# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project is a Base blockchain wallet analytics tool that allows users to check their transaction count and gas usage. It has evolved from a comprehensive "Base Wrapped" application to a more focused tool that tracks just transaction count and gas spent. Now we want to update the UI to match the "Base Wrapped" aesthetic with a pixel art style and confetti elements.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integration with blockchain data sources (initially used ethers.js provider, later switched to Basescan API)
- Handling blockchain data retrieval and processing efficiently
- Error handling for blockchain API calls
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users
- Implementing a pixelated/retro UI with animated elements
- Adding real-time ETH price conversion for gas calculations
- Calculating total transaction volume from transaction history
- Creating a sleek, modern UI that adapts to all device sizes

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [Current state] The application allows users to enter a Base wallet address and view both their total transaction count and the amount of ETH spent on gas fees, with clear distinction between total and outgoing transactions.
- [Completed] Redesign the UI to match the "Based Baby" aesthetic with pixel art style, confetti elements, and engaging copy
- [Completed] Add USD conversion for gas spent using real-time ETH price from CoinGecko
- [Completed] Replace simulated NFTs with actual transaction volume data
- [Completed] Enhance the UI to be sleeker and more responsive across all device sizes

## Project Status Board
- [x] Initial project setup with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement main wallet lookup interface
- [x] Integrate with Basescan API for transaction data
- [x] Display transaction count and gas usage metrics
- [x] Add mobile responsiveness
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Optimize blockchain API calls
- [x] Implement pixel art UI with "Based Baby" branding
- [x] Add confetti/particle background effects
- [x] Create the blue wave design with year markers
- [x] Update copy to be more engaging and playful
- [x] Ensure responsive design for the new UI
- [x] Add USD value calculation for gas spent using CoinGecko API
- [x] Calculate and display total transaction volume in ETH and USD
- [x] Enhance UI with sleek animations and glass-morphism design
- [x] Optimize responsive design for all device sizes
- [x] Improve particle background with better responsiveness

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The application now has a sleek, modern UI with a pixel art aesthetic for the "Based Baby" brand. It features responsive glass-morphism cards, smooth animations, and an enhanced particle background. The app displays transaction data (count and volume) and gas usage in both ETH and USD, with the UI optimized for all device sizes from mobile to desktop.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use proxy/eth_getTransactionCount endpoint for more efficient data retrieval
- When implementing new UI designs, reuse existing components where possible to maintain consistency
- Always include error handling and fallback values when fetching external API data like cryptocurrency prices
- When displaying financial data, show both cryptocurrency and fiat values when possible
- Use CSS custom properties for better theming and consistency across components
- Implement progressive enhancement for animations to ensure they don't affect performance on lower-end devices
