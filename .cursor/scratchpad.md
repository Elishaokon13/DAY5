# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project is a Base blockchain wallet analytics tool that allows users to check their transaction count and gas usage. It has evolved from a comprehensive "Base Wrapped" application to a more focused tool that tracks just transaction count and gas spent. Now we want to update the UI to match the "Base Wrapped" aesthetic with a pixel art style and confetti elements.

The user wants to significantly enhance the wallet analytics tool with three major features:
1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Let users view analytics for the same address across multiple chains (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.).
2. **Historical Balance & Portfolio Chart**: Visualize the user's ETH/USDC balance and portfolio value (in USD) over time.
3. **Protocol/Category Breakdown**: Show which protocols/dApps the user interacts with most, by volume or count, with a pie or bar chart.

These features will make the app more comprehensive, competitive, and engaging for users who use multiple chains and want deeper insights into their onchain activity.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integration with blockchain data sources (initially used ethers.js provider, later switched to Basescan API)
- Handling blockchain data retrieval and processing efficiently
- Error handling for blockchain API calls
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users
- Implementing a pixelated/retro UI with animated elements
- Adding real-time ETH price conversion for gas calculations
- Calculating total transaction volume from transaction history
- Creating a sleek, modern UI that adapts to all device sizes
- Implementing animated line background for a more professional look

## Multi-Chain Support
- Abstracting data-fetching logic to support multiple chains with different APIs and data formats.
- Handling different token/NFT contracts and explorers per chain.
- UI/UX for chain selection and cross-chain summaries.

## Historical Balance & Portfolio Chart
- Efficiently fetching historical balances (block-by-block or via third-party APIs).
- Getting accurate historical price data for tokens (ETH, USDC, etc.).
- Charting and visualizing time-series data in a performant, responsive way.

## Protocol/Category Breakdown
- Identifying protocols/dApps from transaction data (contract address mapping, signature decoding, or third-party APIs).
- Categorizing protocols (DEX, lending, NFT, bridge, etc.).
- Aggregating and visualizing the data (pie/bar charts, top lists).

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [Current state] The application allows users to enter a Base wallet address and view both their total transaction count and the amount of ETH spent on gas fees, with clear distinction between total and outgoing transactions.
- [Completed] Redesign the UI to match the "Based Baby" aesthetic with pixel art style, confetti elements, and engaging copy
- [Completed] Add USD conversion for gas spent using real-time ETH price from CoinGecko
- [Completed] Replace simulated NFTs with actual transaction volume data
- [Completed] Enhance the UI to be sleeker and more responsive across all device sizes
- [Completed] Add animated line background for a more professional and engaging look

## Multi-Chain Support
- [ ] Research and select supported chains (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.).
- [ ] Abstract backend data-fetching logic to accept a `chain` parameter.
- [ ] Integrate with APIs/providers for each chain (Etherscan, Optimism Explorer, Arbiscan, etc.).
- [ ] Update frontend to add a chain selector (dropdown or tabs).
- [ ] Display analytics for the selected chain.
- [ ] (Optional) Show a summary view across all chains.

## Historical Balance & Portfolio Chart
- [ ] Research APIs for historical balances (Covalent, Alchemy, Etherscan, etc.).
- [ ] Implement backend logic to fetch historical balances for ETH/USDC.
- [ ] Fetch historical price data for tokens (CoinGecko, CryptoCompare, etc.).
- [ ] Aggregate and format data for charting.
- [ ] Integrate a charting library (Chart.js, Recharts, ApexCharts, etc.) in the frontend.
- [ ] Add UI for selecting timeframes (7d, 30d, 90d, custom).

## Protocol/Category Breakdown
- [ ] Research methods/APIs for protocol identification (contract lists, 4byte, DeBank, Zerion, Dune, etc.).
- [ ] Implement backend logic to parse and categorize transactions by protocol/dApp.
- [ ] Aggregate data by protocol/category (volume, count).
- [ ] Integrate a pie/bar chart in the frontend for visualization.
- [ ] Display a list of top dApps/protocols with volume and transaction count.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The application now has a sleek, modern UI with a pixel art aesthetic for the "Based Baby" brand. It features responsive glass-morphism cards, smooth animations, and an animated line background that creates a sophisticated, dynamic feel. The app displays transaction data (count and volume) and gas usage in both ETH and USD, with the UI optimized for all device sizes from mobile to desktop.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use proxy/eth_getTransactionCount endpoint for more efficient data retrieval
- When implementing new UI designs, reuse existing components where possible to maintain consistency
- Always include error handling and fallback values when fetching external API data like cryptocurrency prices
- When displaying financial data, show both cryptocurrency and fiat values when possible
- Use CSS custom properties for better theming and consistency across components
- Implement progressive enhancement for animations to ensure they don't affect performance on lower-end devices
- Consider the visual weight of animated elements to avoid overwhelming the user interface
- None yet.
