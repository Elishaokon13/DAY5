# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project is a multi-chain wallet analytics tool that allows users to check their transaction metrics across different chains (Base, Ethereum, and Optimism). The application has evolved from a Base-only analytics tool to a comprehensive multi-chain solution that provides detailed insights into user's onchain activity.

Current Features:
- Multi-chain support (Base, Ethereum, Optimism)
- Transaction count and gas usage tracking
- USD conversion for all metrics
- Chain-specific name resolution (.eth, .op, .base.eth)
- Chain-specific rank system with custom thresholds
- Profile/avatar integration
- Modern, responsive UI with chain-specific theming

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Data Consistency Across Chains:
   - Different APIs (Basescan, Etherscan, Optimistic Etherscan)
   - Varying data formats and response structures
   - Chain-specific token contracts and addresses
   - Rate limiting and API reliability

2. Name Resolution:
   - Chain-specific naming services (ENS, Optimism Name Service, Base Name Service)
   - Different resolver contracts and methods
   - Handling resolution failures gracefully
   - Caching resolved names for performance

3. UI/UX Considerations:
   - Chain-specific theming and branding
   - Responsive design across all device sizes
   - Clear error messaging for chain-specific issues

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The application now has a sleek, modern UI with a pixel art aesthetic for the "Based Baby" brand. It features responsive glass-morphism cards, smooth animations, and an animated line background that creates a sophisticated, dynamic feel. The app displays transaction data (count and volume) and gas usage in both ETH and USD, with the UI optimized for all device sizes from mobile to desktop.

Currently implementing: Backend function to fetch ETH and USDC balances for a given address at daily intervals over a date range using Alchemy.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Starting backend implementation for historical balance charting. Will need Alchemy API key and USDC contract address for each chain supported.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use proxy/eth_getTransactionCount endpoint for more efficient data retrieval
- When implementing new UI designs, reuse existing components where possible to maintain consistency
- Always include error handling and fallback values when fetching external API data like cryptocurrency prices
- When displaying financial data, show both cryptocurrency and fiat values when possible
- Use CSS custom properties for better theming and consistency across components
- Implement progressive enhancement for animations to ensure they don't affect performance on lower-end devices
- Consider the visual weight of animated elements to avoid overwhelming the user interface
- None yet.
