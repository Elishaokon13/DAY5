# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project is a Base blockchain wallet analytics tool that allows users to check their transaction count and gas usage. It has evolved from a comprehensive "Base Wrapped" application to a more focused tool that tracks just transaction count and gas spent. Now we want to update the UI to match the "Base Wrapped" aesthetic with a pixel art style and confetti elements.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integration with blockchain data sources (initially used ethers.js provider, later switched to Basescan API)
- Handling blockchain data retrieval and processing efficiently
- Error handling for blockchain API calls
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users
- Implementing a pixelated/retro UI with animated elements
- Adding real-time ETH price conversion for gas calculations

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [Current state] The application allows users to enter a Base wallet address and view both their total transaction count and the amount of ETH spent on gas fees, with clear distinction between total and outgoing transactions.
- [Completed] Redesign the UI to match the "Based Baby" aesthetic with pixel art style, confetti elements, and engaging copy
- [Completed] Add USD conversion for gas spent using real-time ETH price from CoinGecko

## Project Status Board
- [x] Initial project setup with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement main wallet lookup interface
- [x] Integrate with Basescan API for transaction data
- [x] Display transaction count and gas usage metrics
- [x] Add mobile responsiveness
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Optimize blockchain API calls
- [x] Implement pixel art UI with "Based Baby" branding
- [x] Add confetti/particle background effects
- [x] Create the blue wave design with year markers
- [x] Update copy to be more engaging and playful
- [x] Ensure responsive design for the new UI
- [x] Add USD value calculation for gas spent using CoinGecko API

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The application now has a fully redesigned UI inspired by the "Based Baby" aesthetic. It features a pixel art style with confetti/particle elements, engaging copy, and a blue wave design. The UI is responsive and shows transaction data in an appealing, retro-style layout consistent with the provided reference image. Gas spending is now displayed in both ETH and USD based on real-time price data.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use proxy/eth_getTransactionCount endpoint for more efficient data retrieval
- When implementing new UI designs, reuse existing components where possible to maintain consistency
- Always include error handling and fallback values when fetching external API data like cryptocurrency prices
