# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project is a Base blockchain wallet analytics tool that allows users to check their transaction count and gas usage. It has evolved from a comprehensive "Base Wrapped" application to a more focused tool that tracks just transaction count and gas spent.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Integration with blockchain data sources (initially used ethers.js provider, later switched to Basescan API)
- Handling blockchain data retrieval and processing efficiently
- Error handling for blockchain API calls
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [Current state] The application allows users to enter a Base wallet address and view both their total transaction count and the amount of ETH spent on gas fees, with clear distinction between total and outgoing transactions.

## Project Status Board
- [x] Initial project setup with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement main wallet lookup interface
- [x] Integrate with Basescan API for transaction data
- [x] Display transaction count and gas usage metrics
- [x] Add mobile responsiveness
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Optimize blockchain API calls

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The application currently tracks transaction count and gas usage for Base wallet addresses using the Basescan API. The UI is responsive and shows both total transactions and outgoing transactions, along with gas spent in ETH.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
No current requests.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- Use proxy/eth_getTransactionCount endpoint for more efficient data retrieval
